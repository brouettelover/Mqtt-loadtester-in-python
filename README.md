# Mqtt loadtester in python 
 A simple mqtt loadtester made in python

##Prerequise
You need to have pip to install the dependencies

##Install the dependencies
pip install paho-mqtt
pip install configparser
pip install random
pip install optparse
 
##Change the config.ini
change the files with your paremeters

>[account]
>username = user
>password = pass
>[config]
>server = ip
>port = port

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
